            <p>
                Once upon a time in a little village, that isn't very far from our current location on mother Earth, lived a seventy-four year old master farmer by the name Lorem Ipsum. He, as told by the village locals, had a certain knack for doing things. Not just anything but many things. Like this one time he rode his new motorcycle that he had just bought into Estuardo's farm land and had destroyed all his crops on riding upon them. Word got around that he had done that deliberately so as to gain some recognition from Estuardo. Sources don't really know why he wanted that recognition. Some obvious conclusion was that since Estuardo was the richest landlord in the village maybe then because of that Lorem would get some sort of punishment from him. And because of that, just maybe, Lorem might have to compel himself to figure out a way to make things right. Since nothing much happened in this village, it was Lorem who would plan some of the most elaborate plans to get the word going around from time to time and get the community involved. So for the case of punishment from Estuardo it is said that Lorem Ipsum had been assigned the task of creating the most reliable business plan the history had ever seen. As a matter of fact Lorem Ipsum happened to have founded Gelato Creameries®. He first founded it in 1999. The prevailing years have been a history worth looking back at since then. And so as for the taste the Gelatos have been a terrific Summer buster for the village folk and the world alike. His recipe has since been the talk of every household and horeca and has been a secret to anybody who would want to know it to this very day!
